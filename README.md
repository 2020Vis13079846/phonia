Phonia Toolkit is one of the most advanced tools to scan  phone numbers using only free resources. The goal is to first  gather standard information such as country, area, carrier and  line type on any international phone numbers with a very good  accuracy. Then search for footprints on search engines to  try to find the VoIP provider or identify the owner.
